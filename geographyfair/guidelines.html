<h1><center>Geography Fair Guidelines for Students</center></h1>

A Geography Fair provides a creative approach to learning Geography. The 
concept is simple - each student researches a country or region and reports 
to the group using displays, posters, reports (oral and/or written), games, 
etc. Here are the guidelines.

<ol>

<li>Choose a country or region. Submit the choice to the teacher for approval.
<p>
<li>Research the country or region using the library and the Internet. A good
   starting point for Internet research is www.GeographyFair.com, which
   provides links to many useful sites. Below is a list of the kinds of
   information that should be collected.

   <ul>
     <li><b>Overview:</b> Show the location of the country using maps and
         textual descriptions. List the country's physical characteristics
         including climate and landforms. Pictures are appropriate here. Show
         the country's flag and other national symbols.
      <li><b>Population:</b> Show the total population and also interesting
         facts like population of ethnic groups and changes over time in the
         population.  This is a good place for charts and graphs.
      <li><b>Culture:</b> Explain cultural characteristics of the country such
         as language, food, religion, entertainment, clothing, games, etc.
      <li><b>History:</b> Tell when and how was the country formed. List
         significant events in the country's history.
      <li><b>Economy:</b> What kind of work is common. What are the main
         products
         produced? What products are exported? What products are imported?
         How do people live? Where do they live? What are the cities like?
         What are the rural areas like?  How have geographical features
         affected the economy?
      <li><b>Environment:</b> How have people changed the place? What
         environmental problems is this country facing and what are they
         doing to fix the problems?
      <li><b>Other:</b> Find other interesting facts about the country. In
         what ways is this country unique? In what ways is it like other
         countries?
    </ul>

<p>
<li>Present the information. Prepare a written report and create a table-top
    display or poster.
    <p>
    The written report should contain detailed information on your country or
    region. It should include a title page listing the name of the country or
    region, your name, your teacher's name, school name, and class. The written
    report is mostly text, not many pictures or graphs. The display is where the
    pictures and graphs will be used.
    <p>
    Tri-fold display boards work will for table-top displays. They support
    themselves well and can be purchased online or at local school or office
    supply stores. You want your display to attract attention, but without
    being gaudy.  Make sure the name of the country or region is eye-catching
    and easy to read from a distance. Use some color, but not a lot of
    different colors. Color pictures and charts look good. Text can be put on
    colored paper or matted with colored paper. Small items from the country,
    if available, can be placed on the table in front of the display. These
    kinds of items add significantly to the attractiveness of the display.

<p>
<li>Extra credit: create a game, write a song, make up a skit, or find another
    creative way to convey information about your country or region.
