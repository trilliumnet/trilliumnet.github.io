    <h2>Manoa Falls</h2>

    <p>
    Manoa Falls is the most popular waterfall on Oahu. A 1.6 mile (round trip)
    hike through a lush rainforest leads to the 100ft waterfall. The hike 
    features bamboo groves, tropical flowers, and towering trees before 
    reaching the magnificent Manoa Falls.  This trail is very popular because 
    it is a relatively easy hike, it is easily accessible from Waikiki, and 
    it ends with a beautiful waterfall. When you visit Hawaii, you have to 
    see at least one waterfall. Manoa Falls is the easiest waterfall to get to from 
    Waikiki. The Manoa Valley is very different from most of the other tourist
    sights on Oahu. Most of the other popular attractions are sunny, near the
    beach, have panoramic views, or involved historical sights. The Manoa falls
    trail is shaded, often raining, and the mountains and vegetation restrict
    the view. It is very interesting to experience the contrast.

<h2>Manoa Falls Trail Description</h2>
  <p>
  The trail is a moderate 1.6 mile round trip hike at the base of the 
  Ko'olau Mountains. Allow at least an hour and half for the hike, maybe 
  two hours. Most of the trail is shaded since it wanders through a tropical 
  rain forest. It is often rainy on the trail, even when it is sunny in 
  Waikiki. Brief showers often pop up. The 
  trail is usually muddy, so be prepared to get your shoes (and maybe more) 
  dirty. Hiking boots are not absolutely necessary for this trail. But you 
  need decent shoes, not flip flops. The trail is well maintained, but the 
  terrain is rocky and uneven at some places and will be slippery when wet 
  (which is most of the time). The gentle slopping trail gains about 600 feet
  elevation over the .8 miles to the falls. Consider bug spray as mosquitoes 
  can be a problem on the trail.
  </p>

<h2>Food</h2>
  <p>
  Rainbow's End snack shop is located near the trail head. They serve sandwiches,
  hot dogs, and snacks. Their shave ice is highly recommended after a hike. They
  also have hiking supplies like water bottles, insect repellent, and rain ponchos.
  </p>
  <p>
  Treetops Restaurant, also located near the trail head, is a second story
  restaurant with a beautiful canopy-level view of the rainforest where parots 
  are often seen in the tree tops. It is only open for lunch.

Waikiki) to Philips St. Turn right on Philips St. Take the first left onto 
Punahou St. Punahou St. turns slightly right and becomes Manoa Road. Follow 
Manoa Road to the end of the road. Note: East Manoa Road splits off to the

</p>

<p>
<b>Public Transportation (theBus):</b><br>
Take bus #5 from Ala Moana center to the last stop. The bus takes about 25 
minutes (more like an hour when you add wait time and walking time). 
Walk about 1/2 mile from the bus stop to the trail head. There are 
signs near the bus stop pointing to Manoa Falls. You can take a bus to Ala 
Moana if your hotel is not within walking distance. Be sure to get a 
transfer when you get on the first bus so you won't have to pay for the 
second bus. The cost is $2.50 (exact change). Discounts are available for 
children and seniors.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tour buses:</b><br>
A number of tour companies take bus or van tours to Manoa Falls. Inquire at 
your hotel. The hotel can put you in touch with these tour companies. This option 
will be quite a bit more expensive than theBus, but it is a lot easier since 
they will pick you up at your hotel, get you to the right place, and then 
return you to the hotel. Also, they will usually have a knowledgable guide.
</p>


<p>
<b>Taxi Cab:</b><br>
Cabs are numerous in Waikiki. They are more expensive than theBus, 
but will get you there and back a lot faster.
</p>
