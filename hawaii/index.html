    <h2>Planning a trip to Hawaii</h2>
    <p>
    The island of Oahu is the most popular tourist destination in Hawaii and 
    Waikiki is the most popular place to stay on Oahu. Waikiki makes a great
    place to base your Hawaiian vacation due to the many hotels, restaurants, shopping
    areas, and of course the world famous Waikiki beach. When you want to get
    away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist area, Waikiki is just 
    a short distance from rainforests, hiking trails, historic sites, scenic
    lookouts, and secluded beaches. There are many transportation options from
    Waikiki including rental cars, cabs, tour buses, and public transportation
    on "theBus". Below is a list of things to do in Hawaii, divided into 
    sections that can be done in one day from Waikiki. The one day itineraries 
    below assume a relaxed pace. If you want to see and do more in the time you 
    have, there are notes about where 2 days of activities can be combined
    into one.
    </p>

<h3>Day 1: Waikiki</h3>
Waikiki, on the south shore of the Hawaiian island of Oahu, is a district of 
the city Honolulu and home to one of the most famous beaches in the world.
Waikiki hosts numerous hotels, restaurants, shopping areas, and 1.5 miles of
beaches. Everything in Waikiki is within walking distance, or you can take
"theBus". You could spend your entire vacation in Waikiki (but don't, there are
too many other cool things to see and do on the island).
<ul>
    <li>Waikiki is best known for Waikiki beach. Actually, Waikiki beach 
    consists of a series of consecutive beaches. Each beach has a unique 
    personality. The Waikiki beaches, from east to west, are: 


<ol>
<li>San Souci Beach is a good swimming beach with calm waves due to the 
    protection by a reef. Located on the far east section, it tends to not be
    as crowded.
<li>Queens Surf Beach is a good snorkeling beach due to clear and calm waters. 
<li>Kuhio Beach has an offshore retaining wall that keeps the water calm. This
    is a great beach for families.
<li>Royal Manoa Beach is located right in the heart of Waikiki beach and is one
    of the most crowded sections.
<li>Fort DeRussy Beach is located next to a park with picnic tables and 
    shelters. It is also one of the more crowded sections.
<li>Kahanamoku Beach, named after legendary surfer Duke Kahanamoku, includes
    a man-made lagoon in front of the Hilton Hawaiian Village.
</ol>


    <li>Waikiki boasts many shopping areas including:
<ol>
       <li><a href=http://www.internationalmarketplacewaikiki.com>International Market Place</a>
       <li><a href=http://www.vacationidea.com/hawaii/kalakauaavenue.html>
          Kalakaua Avenue</a> --
          Waikiki's 2 mile ocean front street, ends at diamond head --
          hotels, parks, and attractions<br>
        <li><a href=http://www.alamoanacenter.com>Ala Moana Shopping Area</a>
          beside Ala Moana Beach Park<br>
        <li><a href=http://www.gohawaii.com/oahu/regions-neighborhoods/honolulu/kapahulu>
        Kapahulu</a>, unique shops and local food, next to waikiki
</ol>
    <li>Ala Moana Beach Park (which includes Magic Island) is a less crowded
        park and beach next to Waikiki. It has picnic tables, shallow 
        calm water, and is a great place to watch a sunset.
    <li>Sailboat ride on a catermaran. There a many catermarans that sail
        from waikiki. They range from small 6 person boats to large boats that
        seat several hundred. Sightseeing cruises, snorkeling cruises and
        sunset dinner cruises are abundant.
    <li>Try <a href=http://www.gohawaii.com/oahu/guidebook/topics/learn-how-to-surf-on-oahu>
        surfing</a> (start with a boogie board to get used to the waves) 
        Surfing lessons are available in lots of places along the beach.
        Beach vendors don't require reservations, just show up for lessons<br>
    <li><a href=http://www.waikikiimprovement.com/trail.html>Waikiki historical trail</a>
    <li>Waikiki aquarium

  <br>Hanauma Bay
</div>
<h3>Day 2: Snorkle at Hanauma Bay</h3>

<p>
<a href="hanauma-bay.html">
Hanauma bay</a> nature preserve is one of the most popular tourist destinations on 
Oahu. The curved bay protects the beach from the waves and the coral attracts 
all kinds of colorful tropical fish, sea turtles, and other sea life making 
this one of the best snorkeling spots in Hawaii. Beginning snorklers can stay 
in shallow, protected water and still see amazing fish. You can see fish in
places that are only waist deep. Lifeguards are on duty. More advanced 
snorkelers and scuba divers can move into deeper waters. There is a large 
sandy beach, picnic areas, and trails with breathtaking views.
</p>

<p>
Hanauma bay is located on the southeast coast of Oahu about 10 miles east
of Waikiki off route 72 (the main coastal highway). It is easily reachable
by car, bus (bus #22 from Kuhio ave in Waikiki), or taxi cab. There are also 
tour companies that will pick up at your hotel and provide snorkel gear.
Get there early. The parking lot fills up by late morning, the bay gets
crowded, the lines are long, and the water is not as clear.
</p>

<p>
Hanauma bay is open from 6am-7pm in the summer and 6am-6pm in the winter. It
is closed on Tuesdays.
Admission cost is $7.50 per person. Parking is $1 per car. A snack bar is
available, or you can bring a picnic. Snorkel gear rental is available.
Locker rentals are available to store valauables. Restrooms and showers
are available.
</p>

<p>
You can easily do Hanauma Bay in 1/2 day. If you want to do more on the
same day, drive the rest of the south shore. See south shore details below.
</p>

</div>
<h3>Day 3: South Shore</h3>
The South Shore of Oahu has many beaches, scenic pulloffs, and hiking trails.
The best way to see the south shore is to rent a car and drive. The city bus
(theBus) also travels this route, so you can get to all of these places on
the theBus.
Bigger surf here, especially in the summer, means some of the beaches may
not be as safe for swimming. But they can be great for body boarding and
boggie boarding for experience people.
There are not a lot of options for lunch along the South shore. Hanauma Bay
and Sea Life park both have snack bars.
<ul>
      <li>Drive 4 miles from Waikiki to 
          <a href="diamond-head.html">Diamond Head </a>
          crater. There is a very
          nice 1 mile trail to the top with spectacular views of the ocean,
          Waikiki, and the inside of the crater. The hike will take 1-2 hours. 
          Or you can drive into the crater, look around, and be on your way in
          just a few minutes.
      <li>Drive 17 miles to Hanauma Bay. Hanauma Bay is one of the most 
          popular snorkeling spots in Hawaii. If you don't want to snorkle,
          at least pull off in the scenic lookout area. The Bay is absolutely
          beautiful.
      <li>Drive about 2 miles to Halona Blow Hole. The blow hole is more
          spectacular at some times than others, depending on the surf.
      <li>Drive less than 1/2 mile to Sandy Beach. This beach is popular for
          body boarding, but not safe for swimming when the surf is up. 
          Restrooms are available here.
      <li>Drive about 1 mile to Koko Head botanical garden and Koko head
          trail. The botanical garden is nothing spectacular, but it is free.
          The trail is about 1 mile each way. It is steep and there is no shade,
          but provides a great view at the top.
      <li>Drive about 1 mile to Makapu'u lighthouse trail. It is a relatively
          easy 1 mile (2 miles round trip) hike. The trail is paved. The view
          from the top is absolutely magnificient. If you don't want to hike
          the trail, drive just past the parking area and there is a scenic
          pulloff with a similar view (not a panoramic view like from the top,
          but still a nice view).
      <li>Drive less than 1 mile to Makapu'u beach. Restrooms are available
          (not very clean). Strong waves and currents make it not the safest
          for swimming. (this is really on the east shore, not south)<br>
      <li>Sea life Park is right across the street from Makapu'u beach. 
          A restuarant is available.
      <li>Could optionally visit Mariner's Ridge trail. 
          Great views from the ridge, but long (3 miles rt) and difficult hike.
      <li>The fastest way back to Waikiki is the return the same route. Or
          you could continue up the east coast and return via Pali Highway.
</ul>



<h3>Day 4: Polynesion Cultural Center</h3>
<p>
     The <a href=http://www.polynesia.com/>Polynesian cultural center</a> is
     a living museum highlighting the culture of the polynesian islands.
</p>
<p>
     Polynesia is a large group of islands, including the Hawaiian islands, 
     located in the Pacific ocean. The Polynesian islands include
     Hawaii, Samoa, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Easter Island, Tahiti,
     and French Polynesia. The people of these islands are called
     Polynesians.
</p>
<p>
     The Polynesian cultural center can easily be an all day activity, or
     just a couple of hours. Choose one of more of the three 
     main activities:
     <ul>
         <li>Polynesian Villages: Eight island villages and exhibits 
         representing the Islands of Aotearoa New Zealand, Fiji, Hawaii, 
         Samoa, Marquesas, Rapa Nui, Tonga and Tahiti.
         <li>The Luau: Ali'i Luau.
         <li>The evening show: HA Breath of Life.
     </ul>

<h3>Day 5: North Shore</h3>
  The North Shore is one of the prettiest drive in Hawaii.
<ul>
     <li>A map of a possible route is shown to the right.
     <li>Drive 30 miles from Waikiki to Kahana Bay (picturesque beach) 
         via highway H3 (H3 is a very cool scenic drive).
     <li>Drive 7 miles to the <a href=http://www.polynesia.com/>Polynesian culture center</a>.
         You may want to take a full day for this on a different day, but you 
         can get a taste in a couple of hours. (admission fee).
     <li>Drive 1 mile to La'ie point. A very scenic view of several 
         small islands and a natural arch.
     <li>Drive 1.5 miles to Moku'auia Island (also called Goat Island). You can wade 
         out to the island (wear reef shoes). There is a beach on the island 
         that is never crowded.
     <li>Drive 4 miles to Kawela Bay/Turtle Bay. The area is protected from 
         large waves providing good swimming and snorkeling
     <li>Drive 6 miles to Sharks Cove. This is one of the best
         places to snorkle. The water is clear and there are lots of fish and
         some turtles.
     <li>Drive 1 mile to Waimea Bay. This is a big surfing spot in the winter.
         Restrooms are available.
     <li>Waimea valley audubon center is one of the best gardens on the island.
         (used to be Waimea Falls Adventure Park).
         There is a waterfall where you can swim. (admission fee).
     <li>Drive 3 miles to Laniakea Beach (also called Turtle Beach). There are
         lots of turtles, which are somewhat tame.
     <li>Drive 3 miles to Hale'iwa, the last (or first) stop in the north shore.
         Hale'iwa is a historic surf town and biggest town on north shore.
         Restaurants are available here.
         Hale'iwa Ali'l beach park is good for picnics and swiming. 
         Restrooms are available.
     <li>Could continue to drive west on hwy 930 (Farrington hwy). 
         There are isolated beaches in this area and a 4 wheel drive road 
         after the pavement ends. You can hike from the end of the paved road
         to the northwest tip of the island.
     <li>Drive 8 miles to the <a href=http://www.dole-plantation.com>
         Dole Pinapple plantation</a>. Allow 1-2 hours.
         The visitor center is free. Also available: Plantation tour $5,

<h3>Day 8: Pearl Harbor</h3>
<!--
<p>
"December 7, 1941 - a date which will live in infamy. The United States of 
America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of 
the Empire of Japan" [Franklin Roosevelt].
</p>
-->
<p>
Pearl Harbor, still an active navy base, houses several World War II memorials,
museums, and ships. You can easily spend an entire day at Pearl Harbor, or
just drop in for a few minutes and see the visitor's center and the harbor so 
you can say you've been there. The Pearl Harbor visitor center is about a
45 minute bus ride (bus 42 Ewa Beach) or 25 minute drive from Waikiki. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
     <li>The main attraction, the
        <a href=http://www.nps.gov/valr/index.htm>USS Arizona memorial</a> 
        is free and takes 75 minutes for the guided tour. Get your free ticket
        at the visitor's center as soon as you arrive. The tickets will be for
        a specific time. The wait time is often 2-3 hours. While waiting, visit
        some of the other attractions.
     <li>The <a href=http://www.bowfin.org>USS Bowfin submarine</a> is a
        retired World War II submarine which is now open for tours. The
        adjacent submarine museum contains artifacts from the Bowfin and
        other submarines. Allow about 30 minutes to tour the sub and another
        30 minutes for the museum.
     <li>The <a href=http://www.ussmissouri.org/>USS Missouri battleship</a> 
         was the location of Japan's unconditional surrender to the Allied 
         Forces to end World War II. Start your visit with a 35 minute guided
         tour, then tour the rest of the ship on your own. You can easily
         spend two hours or more touring the enormous ship.
     <li>The <a href=http://www.pacificaviationmuseum.org/>Pacific Aviation 
         Museum</a>, located on Ford Island, showcases World War II-era 
         planes and artifacts. The Museum is accessed by shuttle buses from  
         the Pearl Harbor Visitor Center.
