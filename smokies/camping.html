The Smokies offers "frontcountry" camping and "backcountry" camping.
Frontcountry camping is camping in developed campsites beside where you
can park your car. Backcountry camping requires hiking with your camping
supplies (backpacking) to a remote campsite or shelter. There is a small
charge for frontcountry camping. Backcountry camping is free, but requires
a permit. The free permit is available from most ranger stations
and visitor centers.
<h2>Frontcountry Camping</h2>
The frontcountry campsites each have individual picnic tables and grills. 
Restrooms and running water are available in all campgrounds. There are no
showers, electrical hookups, or water hookups at any of the campgrounds. Many campgrounds
with RV hookups are available outside the park in Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, Townsend, and
Cherokee. Most campgrounds
are closed in the winter. Smokemont and Cades Cove are open all year.
