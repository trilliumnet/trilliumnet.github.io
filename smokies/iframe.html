              hike is very steep at places. The trailhead is at the Alum Cave Bluffs

              Clingmans dome is the highest point in the park. Because of the 
              elevation, temperatures can be 10-20 degrees cooler than the lower
              elevations. The view from the Bald is spectacular. A walking stick
              can be useful on the rough parts of the trail. The first part of the
              path tends to be wet, so consider waterproof boots.</td>
